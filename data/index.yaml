    description: |
      One of the most common clients used on 2b2t. Great for new players due to ease of use. Includes built-in Baritone, an AI pathfinder bot that can automatically escape spawn. It was made well known during the Rusher War after Rusher's advertisement and through eventual use of many 2b2t YouTubers. Impact has many modules that are useful on 2b2t for explorers, travelers, and builders.
    pros:
      - Easy to use
      - Built-in Baritone
    cons:
      - Nothing special that isn't found in other clients
      - No decent movement cheats

      An open-source fork of KAMI which was known for having a working elytra flight bypass for 2b2t (until elytras were practically disabled in early September 2020), along with features like Impact and proper Baritone integration.

    pros:
      - Open-source
      - Modules work well on 2b2t
    cons:
      - Client not maintained
      - Not always compatible with other clients

    name: Future
    author: 0x22 & Kalju
    price: $20 USD
    homepage: https://futureclient.net/
    description: |
      A paid client advertised by Fit and several other 2b2t YouTubers. Future costs $20 and is one of the few clients that costs money. Avoid any unofficial or "cracked" versions. Even though they can be downloaded for free, they are almost certainly backdoored and will leak your coordinates and maybe worse (IP and Passwords).
    pros:
      - Incredibly stable client
      - Includes Noteblock bot (plays music with noteblocks)
      - Very accurate and quick AutoCrystal
    cons:
      - Extremely slow to update (over 8 months since version 2.9)
      - Due to lack of updates, has nothing that can't be found in other clients
