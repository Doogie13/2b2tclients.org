      One of the most common clients used on 2b2t. Great for new players due to ease of use. Includes built-in Baritone, an AI pathfinder bot that can automatically escape spawn. It was made well known during the Rusher War after Rusher's advertisement and through eventual use of many 2b2t YouTubers. Impact has many modules that are useful on 2b2t for explorers, travelers, and builders.

      An open-source fork of KAMI which was known for having a working elytra flight bypass for 2b2t (until elytras were practically disabled in early September 2020), along with features like Impact and proper Baritone integration. The client receives a new update every few days. There are currently 3 main developers and nearly 60 contributors to the project.

      A client made by Ionar2 which went open source due to the unobfuscated jar being leaked. Currently has no developers and the Discord does not provide technical support for Salhack either. Contains no XRay or search functions but is useful for crystal combat.

      Runs as a Forge mod, open-source with a power user feel to it. It lacks a useful GUI and is configured with only commands. ForgeHax became popular thanks to its book writer for creating ban books/dupe books.

    name: Future

    price: $20 USD
    homepage: https://futureclient.net/
    description: |
      A paid client advertised by Fit and several other 2b2t YouTubers. Future costs $20 and is one of the few clients that costs money. Avoid any unofficial or "cracked" versions. Even though they can be downloaded for free, they are almost certainly backdoored and will leak your coordinates and maybe worse (IP and Passwords).

    description: |
      A $20 PvP client with some unique bypasses developed by GiantNuker and Ionar2 (former developer of Salhack). Used for duping items in late September and early October of 2020, as it has an autoduper module. It is accused of being a ratted client by some. The client was leaked in October of 2020 by Crystallinqq, and he added a backdoor.
